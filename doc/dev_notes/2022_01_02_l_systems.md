# 2022-01-02 l_systems and more

So I also did some work yesterday but didn't make any notes. I expanded the terrain demo to include more inputs, and I made a second terrain demo showing off how you can use 3D noise to make nice clouds (by traversing a 2D slice of the noise space, along two of the 3 dimensions.) That def needs a write up. 

## L Systems
I'd like to have a simple one of these working. So far I have the basics of interpretting generic strings with generic rules using maps. I'm thinking of making a simple Turtle and expose a few possible operations, then let people put in their own rules. 

Ok I have a basic rendering thing working. Includes the leaf bit. Also, I added a random deviation to the angle, which can be tuned with a magnitude variable. 

I'd like to expose a bunch of these variables/constants, and have the inputs all trigger a re-render. Seems like getting rid of the 'generate' button should be a goal if I can do it?

Ok that works. 

This is just a basic L system. I'd like to write another version that has separate control characters for the angle changes. Then I could mimic more of the example systems from the wiki page. 

Then, the 'full' mvp would include things to click to load common example settings.
