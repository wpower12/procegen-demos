# Procedural Generation

A collection of examples in procedurally generating various kinds of content. 

Running examples can be found, online, [here](https://www.powcraft.net/demos/procgen).

## Running Locally

* Clone the repo.
* Install dependencies.
	- `> npm install`
* Generate/watch javascript bundles.
	- `> webpack --watch`
* Watch for css changes/generate styles.
	- `> npm run watch-css`
* Then run the webpack dev server.
	- `> webpack serve`

This will start a local server on `localhost:9000`.
